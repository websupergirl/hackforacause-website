Our problem arises when a donor has traveled a long distance to donate and finds out that we are unable to accept their donation. This can cause frustration and anger, and resentment towards our staff, and may even result in a loss of a donor’s use of our service. We envision a &quot;Tinder for Stuff&quot;, where a donor may access a portal to send us photos of their stuff ahead of time. Our staff could decide if the item is something we want, provide a &quot;likelihood we will take this&quot; score, and send different types of feedback to the potential donor. This could dramatically decrease the number of unproductive trips made to BRING, help us educate our donors on the types of things we take and reasons why we do not accept items, and reduce unwanted fuel over-consumption.",video:[]},{title:"St. Vincent de Paul Society of Lane County",description:"SVdP has a workforce of nearly 700 employees and lacks a suitable means to deliver consistent and current information about policies, benefits, and other resources to our staff.

We currently utilize a spreadsheet for all coordination of deliveries and dietary communication, but we are not utilizing it to it's fullest capacity. Much of our week is spent manually sorting and producing delivery routes and communicating these details to the volunteer delivery drivers. We suspect that there are functions that we are not familiar with which could reduce error and allow our team to spend more time serving clients and volunteers directly.
